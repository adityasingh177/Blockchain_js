# Introduction 

A basic blockchain written in node js

#Steps

1. Build the block of a blockchain.

2. Add a hash to the block using the SHA256 hash function.

3. Create the blockchain as an array of multiple blocks, with the genesis block as its first block.

4. Create a digital signature using the private and public keys so that the digital signature can be added to the transactions performed by the nodes in the blockchain.

5. Creating the mining process in the blockchain by setting the ‘difficulty’ of the blockchain dynamically.
